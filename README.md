# Python & SQL Daily Challenge — 2026

This repository contains my **2026 daily challenge**, where I solve **Python and SQL problems every day** from platforms like **HackerRank** and **LeetCode**.

The goal is to stay consistent, sharpen problem-solving skills, and deepen my understanding of:
- Python programming
- SQL querying and optimization
- Data structures and algorithms
- Analytical thinking and edge-case handling

---

##  Challenge Rules
- Solve **at least one problem daily**
- Problems come from **HackerRank** and **LeetCode**
- Solutions are written in **Python** or **SQL**
- Each solution is organized by:
  - Platform
  - Topic (where applicable)
  - Date or problem name

---

##  Objectives
- Build strong daily coding habits
- Improve speed and accuracy in technical interviews
- Create a public log of growth and consistency
- Revisit and refactor solutions over time

---

##  Tools & Platforms
- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Platforms:** HackerRank, LeetCode  

---

##  Timeline
